              Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat
              individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

            <td>
              Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle
              the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

              Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different
              requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests.

            <td>Interpreter</td>
            <td>Behavioral</td>

              Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the
              representation to interpret sentences in the language.

            <td>Mediator</td>
            <td>Behavioral</td>
            <td>
              Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping
              objects from referring to each other explicitly.

            <td>
              Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state, allowing the object
              to be restored to this state later.

              Define a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents
              are notified and updated automatically.

              Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, and the object will appear to
              change its class.

            <td>Behavioral</td>
            <td>
              Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the
              algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

            <td>Behavioral</td>
            <td>
              Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets
              subclasses redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
